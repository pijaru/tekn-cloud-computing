Secara umum, perbedaan antara layanaan berbasis Iaas, PaaS serta SaaS adalah pada penyediaan infrastruktur sebelum mendeploy aplikasi. 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) : It provides only a base infrastructure (Virtual machine, Software Define Network, Storage attached). End user have to configure and manage platform and environment, deploy applications on it.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): It provides a platform allowing end user to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.

Software as a Service (SaaS) : It is sometimes called to as “on-demand software”. Typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. In SaaS everything can be managed by vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, OSes, virtualization, servers, storage and networking, End users have to use it.

SaaS is a way to deliver software, the provider of the software centrally hosts one or more applications and makes them available to customers over the internet. SaaS architecture is also one of the main pillars of cloud computing. 

An explosion in Cloud computing, driven by cloud service providers such as Microsoft with Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, and IBM, has seen the growth in other products and services being delivered over the internet.
